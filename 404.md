404 error: File not found! Hmm, maybe the URL is mistyped? 🤔

<br />

## The History Of Room 404
It all started with a group of CERN scientists who began working on something which would revolutionize the future: the World Wide Web. Their aim was to create a database infrastructure that allowed access to data (text, picture, video, etc) in various formats through a network.

In an office on the fourth floor (room 404), they placed the Internet's central database: any request for a file was routed to that office, where two or three people would manually locate the requested files and transfer them, over the network, to the person who made that request.

Although restricted to CERN's internal network initially, it was soon extended for outside requests as well. And as the database grew, so did the number of requests and also the number of requests that couldn't be fulfilled - the most common problem being wrong file name requests.

Soon these faulty requests were answered with a standard message: Room 404: file not found.

Later, the manual processes were automated and people could directly query the database but the error message remained the same "404: file not found" The room number remained in the error codes of the official release of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and is still displayed when a browser makes a faulty request to a Web server.
